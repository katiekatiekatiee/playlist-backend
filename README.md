# Playlist Hub

Thank you for using Playlist Hub! This single-page application also has a frontend linked here: https://github.com/katiekatiekatiee/playlist-frontend.

Once in the browser, the client is able to view a wide range of playlists and their associated songs that have been added to their list. New songs can be added from right inside the playlist they are being added to, and songs can also be deleted! Playlists, however, are not subject to manipulation at this time. 

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository in your terminal and that for the frontend. 
Navigate into the file in the terminal and open it.

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Then enter the following into the terminal (backend then frontend, respectively) and view in your browser:

    $ rails s
    $ open index.html


## Usage

Once the backend file is open in a text editor, run "bundle install" to ensure the application's gem dependencies have been downloaded. 

From there, you will enter 'open indedx.html' into the terminal of the frontend repo. 

Once on the page, any viewer can simply click on a playlist to expose that playlist's list of associated songs. Additionally, the form to add a new song to that specific playlist also appears. To add a new song, simply fill out the form and submit it. 

To delete a song entry, simply click "delete" and a message will appear to confirm the deletion was successful.

## Development

After reviewing the backend repo, run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.
